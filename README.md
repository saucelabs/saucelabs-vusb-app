# Virtual USB GUI

This project is an Open Source Virtual USB (vUSB) GUI for
[Sauce Labs vUSB](https://docs.saucelabs.com/mobile-apps/features/virtual-usb/). It provides a simple GUI to start an Android or iOS vUSB session with only a few clicks.

> **NOTE:** Docs for version `1.0.1` can be found [here](https://github.com/saucelabs/saucelabs-vusb-app/tree/v1.0.1)

> vUSB is a mobile app debugging tool that simulates connecting a Sauce Labs real device directly to your local machine
> with a USB cable. It integrates into your development environment as if the device is connected directly to your
> workstation, meaning you can use your choice of homegrown development and testing tools to debug.
>
> vUSB will only work if you are having private devices in your Sauce Labs Real Device cloud. Please contact your
> Customer Success Manager if you have more questions about Sauce Labs private devices.

## Features

- :octocat: **Open Source**. So if you have any recommendations, want to see new features or want to help fix a bug,
  then please feel free to do so. Check our [contributing](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)-docs on how to start.
- :link: **Connect to an existing manual device session**, see
  [here](./docs/SCREENS.md#connected-device-from-an-already-opened-device-session). This will allow you to easily take
  over the device under test, push your app to it and interact with it like you would normally do during a live manual
  session.
- :iphone: **Start a NEW vUSB session through the UI**, see
  [here](./docs/SCREENS.md#connected-device-from-a-clean-session). With this option you can start interacting with the
  device without even to have a Sauce Labs browser window open, just do everything from this app.
- :gear: **Easily change vUSB server settings through the UI**, see [here](./docs/SCREENS.md#settings). This will
  prevent remembering all options that you need to type in the command line, the vUSB GUI will store and re-use them
  each time you use the app.
- :computer: **Automatically connect to ADB, see [here](./docs/SCREENS.md#automatically-connect-adb).** No need to open
  extra terminals, by default it will automatically connect to ADB for you.
- :inbox_tray: **Save logs into files, see [here](./docs/SCREENS.md#write-logs-to-file).** Logs for and the server and
  each device can be saved to a file for you for easy debugging.
- :radio_button: **Use some most used buttons to control the device from the right menu.** When a fresh session through
  this vUSB GUI is started you now also have the option to use the Home (Android/iOS), Rotate (Android/iOS),
  Menu (Android) and Back (Android) buttons through the UI.
- :bulb: and many more!
